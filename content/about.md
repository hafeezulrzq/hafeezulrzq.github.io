I’m currently working in product development and data analysis, with a strong interest in both data science and cybersecurity. I enjoy turning real-world problems into streamlined digital solutions and uncovering patterns in data to drive better decisions.

I hold a degree in Mathematics from Universiti Brunei Darussalam, where my final year research focused on the spatio-temporal analysis of advertised house prices in Brunei, using R for modeling and visualization. This project sparked my ongoing passion for data storytelling and practical analytical tools.

Outside of work, I challenge myself through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions—exploring cryptography, digital forensics, and web exploitation. It’s where my love for puzzles meets a growing drive to understand how things break (and how to secure them).

I also enjoy using R creatively—from building CVs and reproducible reports to presenting insights through Quarto. Whether in data or security, I’m always exploring new ways to blend analytical thinking, technical exploration, and creativity to make an impact.
